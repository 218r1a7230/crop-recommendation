# Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning algorithms (Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors) to recommend optimal crops based on soil and climatic data. A Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI) makes the system user-friendly.

## Introduction

Choosing the right crop to cultivate is crucial for maximizing yields and profitability in agriculture. This project assists farmers in making informed decisions by providing crop recommendations based on various factors such as soil nutrients, climate conditions, and other relevant parameters. The system employs machine learning models and provides a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `Crop_recommendation.csv`.  It is included in the repository.

* Nitrogen (N)
* Phosphorus (P)
* Potassium (K)
* Temperature
* Humidity
* pH
* Rainfall
* **label** (Crop Name - target variable)

## Model

This project utilizes two machine-learning algorithms:

* **Random Forest:**  A popular ensemble learning method known for its accuracy and ability to handle complex datasets.
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** A simple yet effective algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class among their k-nearest neighbors.

The models were trained using Scikit-learn.  The following hyperparameters were used:
